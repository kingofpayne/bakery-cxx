# Bakery

Bakery is a C++ library for building and loading complex binary data files. It
allows creating any kind of data file with a meta-language looking like C++,
with very fast loading time thanks to binary just-in-time compilation.

In the first place, this library has been designed for video games, where
loading assets must be efficient. The meta-language makes editing the assets
with a simple text editor possible.
